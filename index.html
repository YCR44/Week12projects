<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">Code First Girls</a>. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>

<ol>
  <li>HTML is cool
  <li>CSS is cooler
  <li>JS is the best
</ol>

<h2> <i> What do you need to create a website? </i> </h2>

Not much!

<ul>
  <li>A computer (always a good start)
  <li>A text editor (I am using atom)
  <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)
  <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files
</ul>

<p>Follow my progress on <a href="https://github.com/">github</a></p>
